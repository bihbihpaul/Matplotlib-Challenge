                                                                                                   
                                                                  Observations and insights

  The study of the four perspectives drug regimens revealed Capomulin and Ramicane to be the best options in the treatment of the squamous cell carcinoma cancer.
According to the bar plot, Capomulin and Ramicane appear to be the most administered regimens with around 230 candidates whereas Propriva represents the least administered, with a little over 150 candidates. The gender distribution of these candidates shows a slight domination of the male demographic, with 50.4% over the female demographic, with 49.6%. 

  Capomulin and Ramicane efficacy is highlighted in the observation of the box plot of the final tumor volume for each mouse across promising regimens. Of the four promising drug regimens, the volume of the tumor is considerably low for Capomulin and Ramicane. A close observation of candidate s185 reveals a consistent decrease of the tumor’s volume over the 45 days timepoint. From these results, it is safe to advocate for the adoption of Capomulin as a treatment for the squamous cell carcinoma cancer. Moreover, with a solid positive correlation of .84 between candidate’s weight and the average volume of the tumor, it can be inferred that reducing the tumor’s volume by controlling a subject’s weight increases the chances of healing from cancer.
  
  Finally, ceteris paribus, Capomulin should be used in the treatment of the squamous cell carcinoma cancer.
